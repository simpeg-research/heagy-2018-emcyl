    " \n",
    "### Online\n",
    "The notebooks can be run online through [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/simpeg-research/heagy_2018_emcyl/master) or [azure notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/simpeg-research/heagy_2018_emcyl). \n",

    "### Locally\n",
    "To run them locally, you will need to have python installed, preferably through [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then clone this reposiroty. From a command line, run \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/simpeg-research/heagy_2018_emcyl.git\n",
    "```\n",

    "Then `cd` into the `heagy_2018_emcyl`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd heagy_2018_emcyl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup your software environment, we recommend you use the provided conda environment\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "source activate emcyl-environment\n",
    "```\n",

    "You can then launch Jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter will then launch in your web-browser. \n",
